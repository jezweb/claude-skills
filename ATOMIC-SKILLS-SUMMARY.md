# Atomic Skills Architecture - Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Status**: Roadmap Updated ✅

---

## What Changed

We pivoted from **bundled composite skills** to **atomic, domain-focused skills** following Claude Code's philosophy.

### Before (Bundled):
```
❌ cloudflare-react-full-stack  # Combined 5+ technologies
❌ cloudflare-services          # Bundled D1 + R2 + KV + AI + Queues
```

### After (Atomic):
```
✅ cloudflare-d1            # Just D1 database knowledge
✅ cloudflare-r2            # Just R2 storage knowledge
✅ clerk-auth               # All Clerk knowledge (works everywhere)
✅ tailwind-v4-shadcn       # Tailwind + shadcn (kept combined, they're inseparable)
```

---

## Why Atomic?

1. **Composability** - Claude automatically combines skills for complex tasks
2. **Reusability** - Same skill works across different frameworks
3. **Maintainability** - Update Clerk once, benefits all use cases
4. **Token Efficiency** - Only load relevant knowledge
5. **Stack Flexibility** - Users pick their own stack

---

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed Skills (9)

**Batch 1 - Cloudflare Services (6/6 complete)** 🎯
1. `cloudflare-worker-base` - Hono + Vite + wrangler (2h dev, ~60% token savings, 6 errors prevented)
2. `cloudflare-d1` - D1 serverless database (2.5h dev, ~58% token savings, 6 errors prevented)
3. `cloudflare-r2` - R2 object storage (2.5h dev, ~60% token savings, 6 errors prevented)
4. `cloudflare-kv` - KV namespaces (3h dev, ~55% token savings, 6 errors prevented)
5. `cloudflare-workers-ai` - Workers AI (5h dev, ~60% token savings, 6 errors prevented)
6. `cloudflare-vectorize` - Vector search (3h dev, ~65% token savings, 8 errors prevented)
7. `cloudflare-queues` - Async processing (3h dev, ~50% token savings, 8 errors prevented)

**Other Skills (2)**
8. `tailwind-v4-shadcn` - Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui (6h dev, ~70% token savings, 3 errors prevented)
9. `firecrawl-scraper` - Firecrawl v2 API (1.5h dev, ~60% token savings, 6 errors prevented)

### 📋 Planned Atomic Skills (4)

**Batch 2 - Auth & Frameworks (3 skills)**
1. `clerk-auth` - All Clerk knowledge (React, Next.js, CF Workers, JWT)
2. `hono-routing` - Hono patterns (middleware, RPC, typed routes)
3. `react-hook-form-zod` - Forms + validation (client + server)

**Batch 3 - Data & Utilities (1 skill)**
4. `tanstack-query` - Server state management

---

## How Composition Works

### Example Request:
```
User: "Build a Cloudflare full-stack app with database and auth"
```

### Claude's Discovery Process:
```
1. Scans ~/.claude/skills/
2. Reads SKILL.md frontmatter from each skill
3. Matches keywords against user request
4. Discovers relevant skills:
   - cloudflare-worker-base (Hono + Vite)
   - cloudflare-d1 (database)
   - clerk-auth (authentication)
   - tailwind-v4-shadcn (UI)
5. Composes them together automatically
```

### Result:
- Integrated solution from 4 atomic skills
- Each skill contributes its domain expertise
- No bundled "full-stack" skill needed
- User gets exactly what they asked for

---

## Next Steps

### ✅ Batch 1 Complete! (6/6 Cloudflare Services)

All core Cloudflare Workers services are now covered with atomic skills. This provides a complete foundation for building serverless applications on Cloudflare.

### Next Up - Batch 2 (Auth & Frameworks):
1. **clerk-auth** - Critical for most apps with authentication
2. **hono-routing** - Routing patterns for Cloudflare Workers
3. **react-hook-form-zod** - Forms + validation best practices

### Batch 3 (Data & Utilities):
4. **tanstack-query** - Server state management (optional)

---

## Research Protocol

Before building ANY skill:

1. ✅ Check official documentation (Context7 MCP, Cloudflare Docs MCP)
2. ✅ Verify latest package versions on npm
3. ✅ Research known issues on GitHub
4. ✅ Build working example project
5. ✅ Document errors prevented with sources
6. ✅ Create research log in `/planning/research-logs/`

---

## File Structure Standard

```
skills/skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # REQUIRED - Instructions + YAML frontmatter
├── README.md             # OPTIONAL - Quick reference with keywords
├── templates/            # OPTIONAL - Working file templates
├── reference/            # OPTIONAL - Deep-dive documentation
└── examples/             # OPTIONAL - Complete example projects
```

### SKILL.md YAML Frontmatter (Critical):
```yaml
---
name: Skill Display Name
description: |
  What the skill does and when Claude should use it.

  Use when: specific scenarios where this skill applies.

  Keywords: keyword1, keyword2, error messages, technology names
---
```

The `description` field is what Claude uses for discovery!

---

## Token Efficiency Metrics

### Per Skill:
- Manual setup: 8,000-15,000 tokens
- With atomic skill: 3,000-5,000 tokens
- **Savings: ~55-60% per skill**

### Composite Tasks:
- Manual full-stack: 50,000-70,000 tokens
- With 4-5 atomic skills: 15,000-25,000 tokens
- **Savings: ~65-70% total**

---

## Success Criteria (Per Skill)

A skill is "complete" when:

- ✅ SKILL.md has valid YAML frontmatter
- ✅ Description includes "Use when" scenarios and keywords
- ✅ README.md has comprehensive trigger keywords
- ✅ Templates are tested and working
- ✅ Token savings >= 50%
- ✅ Auto-discovery works reliably
- ✅ Known errors documented with sources
- ✅ Production-tested in real project
- ✅ Committed to Git + pushed to GitHub

## Quick Start (Next Session)

When you clear context and want to build the next skill:

1. Read the roadmap to see what's next
2. Follow the research protocol
3. Use cloudflare-worker-base and tailwind-v4-shadcn as reference examples
4. Start with cloudflare-d1 (highest priority)
