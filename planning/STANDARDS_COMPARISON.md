# Official Anthropic Standards vs Our Approach

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-21
**Official Source**: https://github.com/anthropics/skills
**Spec Version**: 1.0 (2025-10-16)

---

## TL;DR

✅ **We are 100% compliant** with official Anthropic Agent Skills Spec
✅ **We exceed minimum requirements** for better quality
✅ **Our additions are compatible** and don't break the standard

---

## Official Requirements (MUST HAVE)

### From agent_skills_spec.md

| Requirement | Official Spec | Our Approach | Status |
|------------|---------------|--------------|--------|
| **SKILL.md file** | Required | ✅ Required | COMPLIANT |
| **YAML frontmatter** | Required | ✅ Required | COMPLIANT |
| **name field** | Required, lowercase hyphen-case | ✅ Required, enforced | COMPLIANT |
| **description field** | Required | ✅ Required, enhanced | COMPLIANT |
| **Markdown body** | No restrictions | ✅ Structured with best practices | COMPLIANT |

**Verdict**: ✅ **FULLY COMPLIANT**

---

## Optional YAML Fields

### From agent_skills_spec.md

| Field | Official Spec | Our Approach | Notes |
|-------|---------------|--------------|-------|
| **license** | Optional | ✅ We use MIT | Recommended |
| **allowed-tools** | Optional (Claude Code only) | ⚠️ Not yet using | Can add when needed |
| **metadata** | Optional (key-value map) | ⚠️ Not yet using | Can add custom fields |

**Verdict**: ✅ **COMPATIBLE** - We can add these anytime without breaking anything

---

## Directory Structure

### Official Anthropic Structure (from skill-creator/SKILL.md)

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
├── scripts/          # Executable code
├── references/       # Documentation to load as needed
└── assets/           # Files used in output
```

### Our Current Structure

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
├── README.md         # ← OUR ADDITION
├── scripts/          # Official (we add when needed)
├── references/       # Official (we call it reference/ sometimes)
└── assets/           # Official (we call it templates/ sometimes)
```

**Key Differences**:
1. **README.md**: We add this for quick reference - NOT required by spec, fully compatible
2. **templates/** vs **assets/**: We use both names depending on content - both valid

**Verdict**: ✅ **COMPATIBLE** - Our additions don't conflict with spec

---

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Official Anthropic Guidance

From skill-creator/SKILL.md:

| Guideline | Official | Our Approach | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------------|--------|
| **Description style** | Third-person ("This skill should be used when...") | ✅ Enforced | COMPLIANT |
| **Instruction style** | Imperative/infinitive ("To do X, run Y") | ✅ Enforced | COMPLIANT |
| **Avoid second person** | Don't use "you should" | ✅ Enforced | COMPLIANT |

**Verdict**: ✅ **FULLY COMPLIANT**

---

## Progressive Disclosure Principle

### Official Anthropic Design

From skill-creator/SKILL.md:

```
1. Metadata (name + description) - Always in context (~100 words)
2. SKILL.md body - When skill triggers (<5k words)
3. Bundled resources - As needed by Claude
```

### Our Approach

```
1. Metadata (name + description + keywords) - Always in context (~150 words)
   ↑ We add more keywords for better discovery
2. SKILL.md body - When skill triggers (<5k words)
   ✅ Same as official
3. Bundled resources (scripts/references/assets) - As needed
   ✅ Same as official
```

**Verdict**: ✅ **ENHANCED BUT COMPATIBLE**

---

## What We Add (Beyond Minimum)

### 1. README.md

**Official**: Not required
**Us**: Always include

**Why**: Quick reference for discovery keywords and metrics
**Impact**: Zero (not parsed by Claude Code skill system)
**Compatibility**: ✅ Fully compatible

### 2. Enhanced Description

**Official**: "Description of what the skill does and when Claude should use it"
**Us**:
```yaml
description: |
  What the skill does.

  Use when: specific scenarios

  Keywords: trigger terms
```

**Why**: Better auto-discovery
**Impact**: Improves skill matching
**Compatibility**: ✅ Fully compatible (just more detailed)

### 3. Production Testing Evidence

**Official**: Not required
**Us**: Document in README and research logs

**Why**: Quality assurance
**Impact**: None on functionality
**Compatibility**: ✅ Fully compatible

### 4. Token Efficiency Metrics

**Official**: Not mentioned
**Us**: Measure and document

**Why**: Prove value
**Impact**: None on functionality
**Compatibility**: ✅ Fully compatible

### 5. Known Issues Documentation

**Official**: Not required
**Us**: Required with GitHub sources

**Why**: Error prevention
**Impact**: Better skill quality
**Compatibility**: ✅ Fully compatible

**Verdict**: ✅ **ALL ADDITIONS ARE COMPATIBLE**

---

## Where We Differ (And Why It's OK)

### Difference #1: Directory Naming

**Official**: `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/`
**Us**: Sometimes use `templates/` or `reference/` (singular)

**Why It's OK**:
- SKILL.md is what matters for discovery
- Directory names are for organization only
- We follow official structure when using scripts

**Action**: Standardize to official names going forward

### Difference #2: README.md

**Official**: Not mentioned
**Us**: Always include

**Why It's OK**:
- Not parsed by skill system
- Helps humans (GitHub, documentation)
- Zero impact on Claude Code functionality

**Action**: Keep doing this

### Difference #3: Enhanced Frontmatter

**Official**: Minimal description
**Us**: Detailed description with keywords

**Why It's OK**:
- Official spec says "description of what it does and when to use it"
- We just provide MORE detail
- Improves discovery accuracy

**Action**: Keep doing this

## Compliance Checklist

When building a skill, verify against official spec:

- [ ] ✅ SKILL.md exists
- [ ] ✅ YAML frontmatter present
- [ ] ✅ `name` field: lowercase hyphen-case, matches directory
- [ ] ✅ `description` field: what it does + when to use
- [ ] ✅ `license` field: MIT or reference to LICENSE file
- [ ] ✅ Third-person description style
- [ ] ✅ Imperative instruction style
- [ ] ✅ No "you should" phrasing
- [ ] ✅ Resources in `scripts/`, `references/`, or `assets/`

**All items checked** = ✅ COMPLIANT

---

## Official Examples We Reference

From https://github.com/anthropics/skills:

1. **skill-creator** - Meta skill about creating skills
2. **template-skill** - Minimal example
3. **document-skills/** - Complex production skills (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX)
4. **mcp-builder** - MCP server generation
5. **artifacts-builder** - Claude.ai artifacts

**Key Takeaways**:
- Even official skills vary in structure
- Some use `scripts/`, others don't
- Quality matters more than perfect uniformity
- SKILL.md frontmatter is the critical piece

---

## What Changed from Our Original Approach

### Before Reading Official Spec

- ❌ Used custom frontmatter fields (version, author, tags)
- ❌ Didn't know about `allowed-tools` field
- ⚠️ Inconsistent use of templates/ vs assets/
- ⚠️ Didn't emphasize third-person descriptions

### After Aligning with Official Spec

- ✅ Removed custom frontmatter fields
- ✅ Documented optional `allowed-tools` and `metadata` fields
- ✅ Standardized on scripts/references/assets structure
- ✅ Enforced third-person, imperative style
- ✅ Referenced official examples

**Impact**: 2 skills needed fixes (cloudflare-workers-ai, cloudflare-vectorize)

---

## Future Considerations

### Potential Official Changes

If Anthropic updates the spec, we need to:
1. Review changes in https://github.com/anthropics/skills
2. Update this comparison document
3. Audit existing skills for compliance
4. Update templates to match new requirements

### Potential Additions We Might Make

**allowed-tools field**:
```yaml
allowed-tools:
  - bash
  - python
```
Use when skill frequently uses specific tools

**metadata field**:
```yaml
metadata:
  category: "cloudflare"
  difficulty: "intermediate"
  estimated-time: "10-15 minutes"
```
Use for custom organization

**Both are officially supported** - we can add anytime
