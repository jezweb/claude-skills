# Verification: Our Approach vs Official Claude Code Docs

**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Verified Against**:
- https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills
- https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents
- https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/plugins
- https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks-guide

---

## ✅ What We're Building: SKILLS

**From Official Docs**: Skills are modular capabilities stored in `~/.claude/skills/` that Claude Code automatically discovers and uses.

**Our Approach**: ✅ CORRECT
- Building skills for `~/.claude/skills/`
- Using SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter
- Providing templates and documentation
- Skills will be auto-discovered by Claude Code

---

## ✅ SKILL.md Format

**From Official Docs**:
```yaml
---
name: Your Skill Name
description: Brief description of what this Skill does and when to use it
---
```

**Our Approach**: ✅ CORRECT (and enhanced)
```yaml
---
name: Skill Name
description: |
  What the skill does.

  Use when: scenarios

  Keywords: trigger terms
---
```

**Verification**: Our existing tailwind-v4-shadcn skill uses this exact format ✅

---

## ✅ Skill Discovery

**From Official Docs**:
- Model-invoked (Claude decides when to use them)
- Based on description field matching user request
- Auto-discovered from `~/.claude/skills/` directory

**Our Approach**: ✅ CORRECT
- Enhanced description with "Use when" scenarios
- Keywords for better matching
- Documentation explains discovery mechanism

---

## ✅ Skill Structure

**From Official Docs** (minimum):
```
skill-name/
└── SKILL.md
```

**Our Approach** (enhanced):
```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md          # Required
├── README.md         # Our addition for quick reference
├── templates/        # Optional: file templates
└── reference/        # Optional: deep-dive docs
```

**Verification**: ✅ CORRECT - We exceed minimum requirements

---

## ❌ What We're NOT Building

### NOT Building: Plugins
**What Plugins Are** (from docs):
- npm packages that extend Claude Code functionality
- Installed via `claude plugins install`
- Can bundle skills, MCP servers, slash commands
- Published to npm registry

**Our Approach**: ✅ NOT building plugins
- We're building standalone skills
- Distributed via GitHub repo
- Installed via symlink script
- Don't need npm packaging

### NOT Building: Sub-agents
**What Sub-agents Are** (from docs):
- Task-specific agents Claude can launch
- Used via Task tool
- For complex, multi-step tasks
- Claude manages their lifecycle

**Our Approach**: ✅ We MAY USE sub-agents during development
- For reviewing skills before commit
- Not building custom sub-agents
- Using built-in sub-agent types

### NOT Building: Hooks
**What Hooks Are** (from docs):
- Scripts that run at specific events
- SessionStart, PreToolUse, etc.
- Configured in `.claude/settings.json`
- For safety checks and automation

**Our Approach**: ✅ NOT building hooks
- Skills don't need hooks
- Hooks are for project-specific automation
- Not relevant to our skill development

---

## ✅ Repository Structure Verification

**What We Have**:
```
claude-skills/
├── README.md             # Skill catalog
├── LICENSE               # MIT
├── CONTRIBUTING.md       # Guidelines
├── planning/             # Planning docs
│   ├── skills-roadmap.md
│   ├── claude-code-skill-standards.md
│   ├── research-protocol.md
│   └── verification-checklist.md (this file)
├── skills/               # Skill implementations (will develop here)
└── scripts/
    ├── install-skill.sh  # Symlink to ~/.claude/skills/
    ├── install-all.sh    # Install all skills
    └── check-versions.sh # Version checking
```

**Verification**: ✅ CORRECT structure for skill development

---

## ✅ Installation Method Verification

**What We're Doing**:
1. Develop skills in `~/Documents/claude-skills/skills/`
2. Test locally
3. Symlink to `~/.claude/skills/skill-name` via script
4. Claude Code auto-discovers from `~/.claude/skills/`

**Verification**: ✅ CORRECT
- Skills must be in `~/.claude/skills/` to be discovered
- Symlinks work (faster dev workflow)
- Claude Code doesn't care if it's symlinked or direct

---

## ✅ Metadata Requirements

**From Official Docs** (required):
- `name` field in frontmatter
- `description` field in frontmatter

**Our Approach** (enhanced):
- ✅ `name` field
- ✅ `description` field (with "Use when" and "Keywords")
- ➕ Version documentation
- ➕ Last updated date
- ➕ Production testing evidence
- ➕ Official docs references

**Verification**: ✅ CORRECT - We meet requirements and exceed them

---

## ✅ Content Guidelines

**From Official Docs**:
- Include what the Skill does
- Include when to use it
- Use key terms users would mention
- Instructions Claude can follow

**Our Approach**: ✅ CORRECT
- Description includes use cases
- Keywords help discovery
- Step-by-step instructions
- Code examples and templates

---

## 🎯 Final Verification

### Are We Building the Right Thing?

**YES** ✅ - We are building:
- **Claude Code Skills** (not API skills, not plugins, not hooks)
- **Stored in ~/.claude/skills/** (correct location)
- **SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter** (correct format)
- **Auto-discovered by Claude Code** (correct mechanism)
- **Templates and documentation** (correct content)

### Are We Following Official Standards?

**YES** ✅ - We are:
- **Using correct YAML frontmatter** (name + description)
- **Following discovery mechanism** (description-based matching)
- **Storing in correct location** (~/.claude/skills/)
- **Providing instructions for Claude** (SKILL.md content)

### Are We Adding Things We Shouldn't?

**NO** ✅ - Our additions are:
- README.md (helpful, not required) ✅
- templates/ (optional, documented in our existing skill) ✅
- reference/ (optional, documented in our existing skill) ✅
- Enhanced frontmatter (compatible, just more detailed) ✅
