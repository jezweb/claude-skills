# Research Protocol for Building Claude Skills

**Purpose**: Ensure every skill is built on accurate, current, official documentation
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-20

## üéØ Core Principle

**Bad skills are worse than no skills.** They perpetuate errors, waste tokens, and damage trust.

Every skill MUST be:
- ‚úÖ Based on official documentation
- ‚úÖ Tested in real environments
- ‚úÖ Using current package versions
- ‚úÖ Preventing known, verified errors
- ‚úÖ Documented with evidence

## üìã Pre-Build Research Checklist

**Before writing ANY skill files, complete this checklist:**

### Step 1: Identify Official Sources (30 min)

- [ ] **Find official documentation** (not blog posts or tutorials)
  - Package docs (e.g., https://tailwindcss.com/docs)
  - GitHub repositories (official repos only)
  - API documentation (latest version)

- [ ] **Check Context7 MCP** for library documentation
  ```
  Use: mcp__context7__resolve-library-id
  Then: mcp__context7__get-library-docs
  ```

- [ ] **Use Cloudflare Docs MCP** (if Cloudflare-related)
  ```
  Use: mcp__cloudflare-docs__search_cloudflare_documentation
  ```

- [ ] **Verify documentation is current**
  - Check "Last Updated" dates
  - Verify version numbers match latest stable
  - Read changelog/release notes

### Step 2: Verify Package Versions (15 min)

- [ ] **Check npm for latest versions**
  ```bash
  npm view <package-name> version
  npm view <package-name> versions --json | tail -20
  ```

- [ ] **Document versions explicitly**
  ```markdown
  ## Tested Versions
  - @cloudflare/vite-plugin: 1.2.3 (latest stable as of 2025-10-20)
  - hono: 4.5.1
  - wrangler: 3.72.0
  ```

- [ ] **Check for breaking changes**
  - Read migration guides
  - Check GitHub issues for "breaking"
  - Note any deprecation warnings

### Step 3: Research Known Issues (30 min)

- [ ] **Search GitHub issues** for common problems
  ```
  Search: "[package-name] error" or "[package-name] doesn't work"
  Filter: Open issues, recently updated
  ```

- [ ] **Check community discussions**
  - Official Discord/Slack if available
  - Stack Overflow for common errors
  - Reddit r/[technology] discussions

- [ ] **Document actual errors encountered**
  ```markdown
  ## Known Issues This Skill Prevents
  | Error | Why It Happens | Source | Fix |
  |-------|---------------|---------|-----|
  | "tw-animate-css not found" | shadcn init adds non-existent import | Issue #123 | Remove line 4 in index.css |
  ```

### Step 4: Build Working Example (1-3 hours)

- [ ] **Create test project from scratch**
  ```bash
  mkdir test-skill-example
  cd test-skill-example
  # Follow your own skill instructions
  ```

- [ ] **Test in target environment**
  - Local development (npm run dev)
  - Production build (npm run build)
  - Deployment (if applicable)

- [ ] **Document actual errors you hit**
  - Screenshot error messages
  - Note console warnings
  - Record fix steps

- [ ] **Verify the fix works**
  - Test multiple times
  - Try different scenarios
  - Confirm no regressions

### Step 5: Cross-Reference Sources (15 min)

- [ ] **Compare official docs to examples**
  - Do official examples work?
  - Are there conflicting patterns?
  - Which is more current?

- [ ] **Check for version-specific issues**
  - Does v4 work like v3?
  - Are there deprecated patterns?
  - What changed recently?

- [ ] **Verify with multiple sources**
  - Official docs
  - Official GitHub repo examples
  - Community-verified solutions

## üö® Red Flags - Stop and Investigate

If you encounter any of these, STOP and investigate further:

### Documentation Red Flags
- ‚ùå Examples in docs don't work when tested
- ‚ùå Multiple conflicting approaches in same docs
- ‚ùå Documentation last updated >1 year ago
- ‚ùå "This feature is experimental" warnings
- ‚ùå No version information provided

### Community Red Flags
- ‚ùå Many recent issues about same problem
- ‚ùå Official team not responding to issues
- ‚ùå Community says "docs are wrong"
- ‚ùå Workarounds instead of official solutions
- ‚ùå Deprecated warnings in console

### Technical Red Flags
- ‚ùå Package has known security vulnerabilities
- ‚ùå Last npm publish >2 years ago
- ‚ùå Breaking changes not documented
- ‚ùå Dependencies conflict with each other
- ‚ùå Tests failing in official repo

**Action**: Document the red flag, investigate root cause, decide if skill is viable.

## üîÑ Maintenance Protocol

Skills need periodic updates when:

### Trigger Events
- New major version of key dependency
- Security vulnerability reported
- Breaking change announced
- Official docs updated significantly
- Community reports skill doesn't work

### Update Process
1. Re-run research checklist
2. Update version numbers
3. Test with new versions
4. Update templates
5. Update documentation
6. Mark "Last Updated" date
7. Commit with changelog

### Update Schedule
- **Quarterly**: Check for version updates
- **Monthly**: Review GitHub issues
- **On-demand**: When users report problems

## üìñ Reference Standards

This protocol ensures skills meet these standards:
- [Official Standards Analysis](official-standards-analysis.md)
- [Skills Roadmap](skills-roadmap.md)
- [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)

---

**Remember**: 15 minutes of research saves hours of debugging. Always verify before building.
